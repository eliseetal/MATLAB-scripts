# MATLAB_scripts
MATLAB scripts designed for use in functional MRI experiments: stimulus presentation, transforming data, automating data analysis pipeline for analysis of brain (fMRI) data. 


# AV_stimuli_V_delay.m
Creates audiovisual stimuli with a visual delay/lag

# hu_score_calculator.m 
Script that reads in raw data, calculates unbiased hit rates using a for loop, and saves each participants' hu scores to separate sheets within an
excel file. 

# familiarity_stim_pres.m 
Experiment I programmed using PsychToolbox to be used within the MRI scanner. 
Task involves presenting voice stimuli to listeners inside the scanner, and requires button presses at various timepoints. 
Timings of stimulus presentation are logged within the task and saved off to a log file to be used later in the analysis alongside the fMRI data collected. 

# Randomisations_familiarity.m 
Script I wrote to create randomised condition and stimulus orders for an experimental task
